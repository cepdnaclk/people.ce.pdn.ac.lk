<a><b><u>BIO</u></b></a>

<p>
    I am currently serving as a Lecturer (Probationary) with a background in both academia and industry. 
    Before joining the academic field, I worked as an Associate Software Engineer at Invorg. I hold a BSc (Hons) degree 
    in Computer Science from the University of Jaffna, and I am presently pursuing MSc in Computer Science with a specialization 
    in Data Science at the University of Moratuwa.
