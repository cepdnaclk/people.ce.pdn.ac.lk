  Isuru received his B.Sc. degree in Engineering from the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka, in
  2011, and his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of New South
  Wales, Sydney, Australia, in 2016. He is currently a Senior Lecturer in Computer Engineering at
  the University of Peradeniya. He has a keen interest in improving the quality of engineering
  education and research, and is involved in curriculum development and devising learner-centered
  delivery methods. He was the former director of the Engineering Education Unit at the University
  of Peradeniya.

  <li><strong>Computer Architecture</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
  I teach arguably one of the best computer architecture foundational courses in the world, followed
  by advanced courses on computer architecture and embedded systems. Materials, practicals, and
  delivery/assessment methods designed by me, the courses continually produce impressive outcomes
  and receive high acclaim. The students who followed these courses and engaged in related research
  projects with me are consistently recruited by world-leading computer architecture companies (ARM,
  SiFive) immediately upon graduation.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cross-Curricular Comprehensive Design Projects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
  I introduced cross-curricular projects into the UoP Computer Engineering Curriculum, with a
  tech-product development project in the third year of study connected to multiple courses
  (distributed software, embedded systems, computer security, etc.). The goals were to enhance the
  applied knowledge and skills through experiential learning, promote entrepreneurship, and prepare
  the students better for industry, which were achieved with great success.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ESCAL</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
  I expanded the Embedded Systems and Computer Architecture Lab at UoP Computer Engineering with the
  additions of ESCAL Makerspace and ESCAL Robotics laboratories. Makerspace is fully equipped for
  modern tech-product development, while the Robotics lab focuses on cutting-edge intelligent
  multi-agent robotic systems.

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I have extensive experience in implementing student-centered pedagogical techniques such as
  flipped-classrooms, formative assessments, peer learning and project-based experiential learning
  using modern tools with great success and demonstrable results. I continue to be an acclaimed
  resource person in the Staff Development Center at UoP, as well as in many other institutions
  around Sri Lanka, on using modern technology to enhance&nbsp;
  <em>Learning for Mastery</em>
  in higher education. I have contributed to changing the mindset of many teachers in higher
  education towards students&rsquo; mastery as opposed to traditional teaching.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Curriculum Development</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
  I lead the design and development of the latest Computer Engineering curriculum at UoP,
  integrating modern content (based on ACM guidelines) with modern pedagogy, which started
  implementation with the 2022-Advanced-Level intake. I have also engaged in developing curricula
  for other institutions in Sri Lanka.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ACES</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
  I guide the Association of Computer Engineering Students as its Senior Treasurer and Advisor. My
  goal is to equip the students with a variety of 21st-century skills to transform them into the
  best versions of themselves. I have initiated several innovative activities to this end, as well
  as to promote industry engagements and expand social outreach.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Proctored Online Examinations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
  I, along with my team, have devised a comprehensive framework to hold&nbsp;
  <a href="http://proctored-exam-handbook.ragel.net/">proctored online exams</a>
  using openly available software tools and conducted the first-ever such examination in Sri Lanka.
  Our team conducted introductory and training sessions at several higher education institutions in
  Sri Lanka.
