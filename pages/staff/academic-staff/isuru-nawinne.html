  <span style="font-weight: 400">
    I teach arguably one of the best computer architecture foundational courses in the world,
    followed up with advanced courses on computer architecture and embedded systems. Materials,
    practicals and delivery/assessment methods designed by myself, the courses continually produce
    impressive outcomes and receive high acclamation. The students who followed these courses and
    engaged in related research projects with me are consistently recruited by world leading
    computer architecture companies (ARM, SiFive) immediately upon graduation.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cross-Curricular Comprehensive Design Projects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
    I introduced cross curricular projects into the UoP Computer Engineering Curriculum, with a
    tech-product development project in the third year of study connected to multiple courses
    (distributed software, embedded systems, computer security, etc.). The goals were to enhance the
    applied knowledge and skills through experiential learning, promote entrepreneurship and to
    prepare the students better for industry, which were achieved with great success.

<ul>
  <li><strong>ESCAL</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
    I expanded the Embedded Systems and Computer Architecture Lab at UoP Computer Engineering with
    the additions of ESCAL Makerspace and ESCAL Robotics laboratories. Makerspace is fully equipped
    for modern tech-product development while the Robotics lab focuses on cutting edge intelligent
    multi-agent robotic systems.

    I have extensive experience in implementing student-centered pedagogical techniques such as
    flipped-classrooms, formative assessments, peer learning and project-based experiential learning
    using modern tools with great success and demonstrable results. I continue to be an acclaimed
    resource person in the Staff Development Center at UoP, as well as in many other institutions
    around Sri Lanka, on using modern technology to enhance

    education towards students&rsquo; mastery as opposed to traditional teaching.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Curriculum Development</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
  <span style="font-weight: 400">
    I lead the design and development of the latest Computer Engineering curriculum at UoP,
    integrating modern content (based on ACM guidelines) with modern pedagogy, which started
    implementation with the 2022-Advanced-Level intake. I have also engaged in developing curricula
    for other institutions in Sri Lanka.
