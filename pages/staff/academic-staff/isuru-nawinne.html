<a><b><u>Highlights:</u></b></a>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computer Architecture</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I teach arguably one of the best computer architecture foundational courses in the world, followed up with advanced courses on computer architecture and embedded systems. Materials, practicals and delivery/assessment methods designed by myself, the courses continually produce impressive outcomes and receive high acclamation. The students who followed these courses and engaged in related research projects with me are consistently recruited by world leading computer architecture companies (ARM, SiFive) immediately upon graduation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross-Curricular Comprehensive Design Projects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I introduced cross curricular projects into the UoP Computer Engineering Curriculum, with a tech-product development project in the third year of study connected to multiple courses (distributed software, embedded systems, computer security, etc.). The goals were to enhance the applied knowledge and skills through experiential learning, promote entrepreneurship and to prepare the students better for industry, which were achieved with great success.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ESCAL</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I expanded the Embedded Systems and Computer Architecture Lab at UoP Computer Engineering with the additions of ESCAL Makerspace and ESCAL Robotics laboratories. Makerspace is fully equipped for modern tech-product development while the Robotics lab focuses on cutting edge intelligent multi-agent robotic systems.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>21</strong><strong>st</strong><strong> Century Higher Education</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have extensive experience in implementing student-centered pedagogical techniques such as flipped-classrooms, formative assessments, peer learning and project-based experiential learning using modern tools with great success and demonstrable results. I continue to be an acclaimed resource person in the Staff Development Center at UoP, as well as in many other institutions around Sri Lanka, on using modern technology to enhance </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning for Mastery</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in higher education. I have contributed to changing the mindset of many teachers in higher education towards students&rsquo; mastery as opposed to traditional teaching.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Curriculum Development</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I lead the design and development of the latest Computer Engineering curriculum at UoP, integrating modern content (based on ACM guidelines) with modern pedagogy, which started implementation with the 2022-Advanced-Level intake. I have also engaged in developing curricula for other institutions in Sri Lanka.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ACES</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guide the Association of Computer Engineering Students as its Senior Treasurer and Advisor. My goal is to equip the students with a variety of 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century skills to transform them into the best versions of themselves. I have initiated several innovative activities to this end, as well as to promote industry engagements and expand social outreach.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proctored Online Examinations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I, along with my team, have devised a comprehensive framework to hold </span><a href="http://proctored-exam-handbook.ragel.net/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proctored online exams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using openly available software tools, and conducted the first ever such examination in Sri Lanka. Our team conducted introductory and training sessions at several higher education institutions in Sri Lanka.</span></p>
