<p>
  Biswajith Dissanayake is a Computer Departmental Lecturer at the Engineering Faculty, University
  of Peradeniya. My work is at the intersection of generative modeling, probabilistic programming,
  and deep learning, with an interest in applications of machine learning for scientific discovery.
  He recently focused on Bayesian inference in large-scale simulators, implementing code for
  distributed training and inference at supercomputing scale. Previously, He was an IT Specialist at
  IBM World Trade Corporation working with telecommunications operations. Before his work at IBM, He
  was a Lecturer at Uva Wellassa University and Peradeniya University CE Departments and Central
  Engineering Counsultancy Bureau. In Russia, he specialized in differentiable programming and
  worked on compositionality, higher-order functions, and nesting of forward and reverse
  differentiation.
