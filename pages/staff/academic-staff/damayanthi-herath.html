<p>
  Dr. Damayanthi Herath is a highly skilled academic with expertise in Computer Engineering, Machine
  Learning, and Computational Biology.&nbsp;
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=G2jUV5IAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">
    Her research interests&nbsp;
  </a>
  are in Explainable AI, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and omics data analysis. Further, she is
  passionate about exploring innovative ways for education, including Edutainment. She is currently
  actively coordinating the Data Engineering and Research (DEAR) group and Computational Biology
  (CompBio) group at Peradeniya. She currently teaches the Artificial Intelligence-related courses
  at the department: Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning and Data Mining, Artificial
  Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems, and Artificial Intelligence, and coordinates the final year
  projects.
</p>
<p>
  Being an advocate for knowledge dissemination, Dr. Damayanthi has organised a number of conference
  workshops and tutorials on machine learning and computational biology.
</p>
<p>
  Dr. Damayanthi has secured multiple grants together with local and international collaborators.
  She is driven by inclusive approaches, fostering innovation, and enabling diverse perspectives to
  tackle complex scientific challenges.
</p>
<p>
  Dr. Damayanthi has supervised a number of undergraduate research students, and postgraduate
  research students. Next to teaching, her key passion is to explore and expand the knowledge
  together with her research students. Her guidance has helped students conduct award-winning
  research and pursue higher studies at prestigious institutions. Through her exceptional
  collaborative skills, she brings together experts from diverse disciplines, creating
  multidisciplinary teams that drive innovation and solve complex scientific challenges.
</p>
<p>
  Dr. Damayanthi earned her B.Sc. (Hons) degree in Computer Engineering from the University of
  Peradeniya in 2012. After serving in the industry, she joined the department as a lecturer in the
  year 2015. She was a member of the Optimisation and Pattern Recognition Research Group of
  Melbourne School of Engineering, The University of Melbourne, as a PhD candidate from 2015-2018.
  where she worked on computational models and methods to profile inherently diverse DNA sequencing
  data, which encodes genetic information of multiple species and organisms. Her work in her PhD
  will assist in understanding the dynamics of microbes, their effects on our surroundings, and the
  functionalities of multiple cells under different environments. She is currently a member of IEEE.
