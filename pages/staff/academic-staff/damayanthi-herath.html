<a><b><u>BIO</u></b></a>

<br>
<p>
Dr. Damayanthi Herath is a highly skilled academic with expertise in Computer Engineering, Machine Learning, and Computational Biology. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=G2jUV5IAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Her research interests </a> are in Explainable AI, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and -omics data analysis. Further, she is passionate on exploring innovative ways for education including edutainment. 
She is currently actively coordinating the Data Engineering and Research (DEAR) group and Computational Biology (CompBio) group at Peradeniya. She currently teaches the Artificial Intelligence related courses at the department: Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning and Data Mining, Artificial Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems, and Artificial Intelligence and coordinates the final year projects.
</p>
<p>
   Being an advocate for knowledge dissemination, Damayanthi has organised a number of conference workshops and tutorials on machine learning and computational biology. 
</p>
<p>
    Damayanthi has secured multiple grants together with local and international collaborators. She is driven for inclusive approaches fostering innovation and for enabling diverse perspectives to tackle complex scientific challenges.
</p>
<p>
    Damayanthi has supervised a number of undergraduate research students, and postgraduate students. Next to teaching, her key passion is to explore and expand the knowledge together with her research students. Her guidance has helped students conducting award winning research and pursuing higher studies at prestigious groups. Through her exceptional collaborative skills, she brings together experts from diverse disciplines, creating multidisciplinary teams that drive innovation and solve complex scientific challenges.
</p>
<p>
    Damayanthi earned her B.Sc. (Hons) degree in Computer Engineering from University of Peradeniya in 2012. After serving in the industry, she joined back the department as a lecturer in the year 2015. he was a member of the Optimisation and Pattern Recognition Research Group of Melbourne School of Engineering, The University of Melbourne as a PhD candidate from 2015-2018. where she worked on computational models and methods to profile inherently diverse DNA sequencing data which encode genetic information of multiple species and organisms. Her work in PhD will assist in understanding the dynamics of microbes, their effects on our surroundings and functionalities of multiple cells under different environments. She is currently a member of IEEE.
