<a><b><u>BIO</u></b></a>

<br>
<p>Damayanthi Herath graduated with a B.Sc. (Hons) in Computer Engineering, University of Peradeniya in year 2012. After
    serving in the industry, she joined back the department as a lecturer in the year 2015. She was a member of the
    Optimisation and Pattern Recognition Research Group of Melbourne School of Engineering, The University of Melbourne
    as a
    PhD candidate from 2015-2018. After completing her graduate studies she is back with the department since January
    2019.</p>
<p>
    During her PhD, Damayanthi worked on computational models and methods to profile inherently diverse DNA sequencing
    data
    which encode genetic information of multiple species and organisms. Her work in PhD will assist in understanding the
    dynamics of microbes, their effects on our surroundings and functionalities of multiple cells under different
    environments.</p>
<p>
    Her research interests are in devising methods based on Mathematics and Computer Science to solve problems in
    biology
    and medicine.</p>
