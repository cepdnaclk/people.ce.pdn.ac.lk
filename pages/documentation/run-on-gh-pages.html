title: How to run this website on GitHub Pages?

<ol>
    <li>
        First, <i>Fork</i> the GitHub Repository (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cepdnaclk/people.ce.pdn.ac.lk">this</a>) into your GitHub account/organization
    </li>

    <li>
        Next, delete the file named, <i>CNAME</i> in the root folder. (This is the file used to configure the subdomain people.ce.pdn.ac.lk and you may not need it)
    </li>

    <li>
        Since now you are hosting the website in a directory like <i>https://{your-github-profile-id}.github.io/people.ce.pdn.ac.lk/</i>, you need to alter the configuration file to generate the links according to it. Please visit the <i>_config.yml</i> file in the root folder, and update the <i>baseurl</i> as follows:
        <br>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-yaml">baseurl: "/people.ce.pdn.ac.lk"</code>
        </pre>
    </li>

    <li>
        Now, you can go to <i>Settings > Pages</i> in your forked GitHub repository, select the <b>Source</b> as your default branch (by default, it is <i>main</i>)  and the folder as <i>/(root)</i>, and hit the <b>Save</b> button.
        <br>

    </li>

    <li>
        The <i>page-build</i> process will take several minutes and after that, you can visit the people site under your GitHub pages subdomain, from a URL in format, <i>https://{your-github-profile-id}.github.io/people.ce.pdn.ac.lk/</i>
    </li>
</ol>

        <div class="card-body">
            Here, you are deleting the <i>CNAME</i> record and altering the <i>_config.yml</i> file. But make  sure to set them back into the original status if you are making a pull request from your repository to the base repository in <i>cepdnaclk</i> organization
