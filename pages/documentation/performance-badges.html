title: Performance Badges
---

<p>
    <i>Badges</i> will be issued by the HoD of the Department of Computer Engineering, to the students to appreciate their performance and contribution to the Department/Faculty/University.
</p>

<p>
    The following guideline is for the site maintainers. Students may not try to create Badges for themself, without approval from the HoD.
</p>

<div>
    To create a new badge, it is required to
    <ol>
        <li>
            Create an image for the badge (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cepdnaclk/people.ce.pdn.ac.lk/blob/main/_graphics/badges_vector.ai">Template</a>) and save it in the folder, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cepdnaclk/people.ce.pdn.ac.lk/tree/main/images/badges">/images/badges/</a>
        </li>

        <li>
            Create a JSON file in the folder, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cepdnaclk/people.ce.pdn.ac.lk/tree/main/badges">/images/badges/</a>. (Template can be found below)
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>


<h4>JSON Template</h4>

<p>
    You need to create a JSON file in the folder, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cepdnaclk/people.ce.pdn.ac.lk/tree/main/badges">/images/badges/</a> to define a new <i>Badge</i>. The template is as below:
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
{
    "title": "Title of the Badge",
    "tag": "Tag of the Badge, need to be link compatible",
    "description": "A short description about the badge",
    "criteria": "The criteria considered to issue the badge",
    "image": "images/badges/{image_name_with_extension}",
    "show_in_profile": "true",
    "students":[
    {
        "eNumber": "E/YY/XX",
        "name": "Name of the Student",
        "position": "Position, designation or the Subtitle to be shown in the student profile",
        "link": "The link to the certificate, if exists (optional)"
    },
    ...
    ]
}
    </code>
</pre>

<div class="alert alert-warning d-flex align-items-center mb-2" role="alert">
    <div>
        <h6>
            <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg> Warning !
        </h6>
        <p>
            <i>The "tag"</i> field should be compatible to be an URL, in such a way that the words are separated by '-' (Ex: For the <i>Web Consultation Team</i>, it must be something like "<i>web-consultation-team</i>"). This tag will be used as the path to the Badge's webpage, which can be accessed from <a href="{{ '/badges/' | relative_url }}">here</a>.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning d-flex align-items-top mb-2" role="alert">
    <div>
        <h6>
            <svg class="bi flex-shrink-0 me-2" width="24" height="24" role="img" aria-label="Warning:"><use xlink:href="#exclamation-triangle-fill"/></svg>Warning !
        </h6>
        <p>
            Once the JSON is edited, make sure to the syntax is correct. you can use <a href="https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/#" target="_blank">this</a> online tool for it.
        </p>

<h4>How this works</h4>

<ol>
    <li>
        There is a <i>python script</i> in <a href="#">here</a>, which will be executed through <i>GitHub Action</i> at a scheduled time or can be executed manually from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cepdnaclk/people.ce.pdn.ac.lk/actions">here</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
        Within that <i>Python script</i>, JSON files will be read and populate the other required infromation from the APIs available in the <a href="https://api.ce.pdn.ac.lk/">api.ce.pdn.ac.lk</a>. Pre-processed details will be stored in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cepdnaclk/people.ce.pdn.ac.lk/blob/main/_data/badges.json">/_data/badges.json</a> as a JSON file. (The data structure was specially designed to help the <i>Liquid Syntax</i> used in Jekyll to easily generate the HTML content)
    </li>

    <li>
        Additionally, the script will generate pages for each Badge in the folder, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cepdnaclk/people.ce.pdn.ac.lk/tree/main/pages/badges/pages">/pages/badges/pages/</a> .
    </li>

    <li>
        When Jekyll is building the website, the Badge information will be added to the student profiles.
    </li>
</ol>
