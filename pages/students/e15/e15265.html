<h3>Bio</h3>

<p>
  I'm a Computer Engineering graduate with a Second Class (Upper) degree, passionate about using
  technology to solve complex problems and drive innovation. As an experienced software engineer, I
  have a strong foundation in Java backend development and machine learning. I'm constantly eager to
  learn and improve my skills to further my technical expertise and achieve my career goals in the
  tech industry. My passion for problem-solving has allowed me to excel in both academic and
  professional pursuits, and I'm excited to continue making meaningful contributions to the field of
  computer engineering.

<p>
  Later I joined
  <a href="https://www.gtntechnologies.com/">GTN Technologies</a>
  as a Software Engineer, and Now I'm working there.
