<h3>Bio</h3>

<p>
  I graduated as a Computer Engineer (BSc. Hons) with First Class in 2021. I
  worked in the Department of Computer Engineering as a
  <i>Temporary Instructor</i> for around a year after my graduation. During that
  time I was able to help on several department's student-driven projects to
  improve the web presence of the Department, including
  <a target="_blank" href="https://projects.ce.pdn.ac.lk"
    >projects.ce.pdn.ac.lk</a
  >,
  <a target="_blank" href="https://people.ce.pdn.ac.lk">people.ce.pdn.ac.lk</a>,
  <a target="_blank" href="https://api.ce.pdn.ac.lk">api.ce.pdn.ac.lk</a>. Also
  I got a chance to support to establish
  <a target="_blank" href="https://make.ce.pdn.ac.lk">ESCAL MakerSpace Lab</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Later I joined <a href="https://rhino-partners.com/">Rhino Partners</a> as a
  Software Engineer, and Now I'm working there.
</p>

<p>
  I'm interested in IoT, Embedded Systems, Robotics, Full Stack Web Development
  and Computer-Aided Designing and Manufacturing.
</p>

<p>
  As a hobby, I'm writing a blog, about both technical and non-technical staff,
  and you can read those posts from
  <a href="https://nuwanjaliyagoda.com/blog/">here</a>.
